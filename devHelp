Let's say you've made some changes to your plugin and updated the version number in shiprocket-woo-shipping.php to 1.0.1. To release this new version, you would:

Commit your changes: git commit -m "Updated plugin to version 1.0.1"
Create a tag: git tag v1.0.1
Push the tag: git push origin --tags
This will trigger your "Release Plugin" workflow on GitHub Actions, which will then create a new release and upload the updated plugin files.
