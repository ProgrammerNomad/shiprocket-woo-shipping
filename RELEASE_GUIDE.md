- ✅ Upload the ZIP as a release asset
- ✅ Update the `update-info.json` file

## 🔄 Auto-Update System

Your plugin includes an automatic update system that works through:

1. **GitHub Releases**: Tagged releases create downloadable ZIP files
2. **Update Info**: The `update-info.json` file tracks the latest version
3. **Auto-Update Workflow**: GitHub Actions automatically updates version info

### How Auto-Update Works:
- When you push a tag (e.g., `v1.0.4`), GitHub Actions triggers
- A new release is created with the plugin ZIP file
- The `update-info.json` is updated with the new version and download URL
- Users with the plugin installed can receive update notifications
